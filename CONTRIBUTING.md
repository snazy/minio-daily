# Contributing to the project
## How to contribute
Everyone is encouraged to contribute to the project.
We welcome of course code changes, 
but we are also grateful for bug reports, feature suggestions, helping with testing and 
documentation, or simply spreading the word.

## Code of conduct
You must agree to abide by the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting issues
Issues can be filed on GitHub. 
The more the community knows the more it can help :-)

### Feature Requests

If you have a feature request or questions about the direction of the project please start a discussion.
It helps build a richer discussion and more people can be involved than when posting as an issue.

### Large changes or improvements

We are excited to accept new contributors and larger changes.
Please post a proposal before submitting a large change.
This helps avoid double work and allows the community to arrive at a consensus on the new feature or improvement.

### Submitting a pull request

Anyone can take part in the review process and once the community is happy and the build actions are passing,
a Pull Request will be merged.
Support must be unanimous for a change to be merged.

### Reporting security issues

Please see our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md)
